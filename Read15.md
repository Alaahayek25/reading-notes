## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

The quest to build the perfect team started five years ago, to start the experiment google managers decided to spend millions studying all aspects of their employee’s lives, from their work ethic and performance to their social skills and off-work activities. They initially thought that the best group would be formed of people that were similar minded and those who had social ties away from the work environment. A few years later the project “Aristotle” came into play, this was based on hundreds of studies about google teams and why some were deteriorating while others were flourishing.

On the other hand, some groups might have the norms of being quiet and to do what they are asked for without discussing anything.*
Some teams might have rules about the way you should speak. Some groups have rules about not interrupting the other speakers while others may welcome interrupting as a part that helps them to generate new ideas.
Some groups may stay formal with each other and keep distance while other teams may proceed to chat with each other.* *- That’s why the personality of the member does not always matter. If an introvert inters a team were debates are welcomed, he\she should try to get into these *environments and the same applies to the extroverts. - The group norms are very important when it comes to the group’s productivity. Even when all of the group members are bright, when they do not work in a comfortable environment, the’ re unlikely to succeed. To conclude, project Aristotle didn’t give the results we expected but they were definitely the results we needed to hear. There is no “right set of people” to create a good team, it didn’t depend on backgrounds or personalities or ethnicity or genders. A good team, depends on creating a safe space, where people felt comfortable and could speak up and take risks, while feeling heard and valued as group members. This, along with making the agenda and goal clear, having “equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking”, and “high average social sensitivity” resulted in identifying the norms for the perfect team.
