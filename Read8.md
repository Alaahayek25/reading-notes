 # Layout in Css
Using th position property, CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:

normal flow. `position:static`
relative positioning. `position:relative`
absolute positioning. `position:absolute`
fixed positioning. `position:fixed`

# Fixed display layouts:

 Fixed width layouts: these are layouts that do not change in size regardless of if the uses changes the size of their viewing screen.

 Size of images never change relative to the rest of the page...
Might cause gaps around edges
-----
Liquid layouts: these layouts stretch and contract to fit the window they are in.


The page might look very different than intended due to uncontrolled width

Lines of text can become very long in wide windows and the opposite in narrow windows

Images may overflow over tex

Inline elements

(remember)
# Inline elements:
- flow in between surrounding text Examples include: `<img>` `<b>` `<i>`
- 
Block-level elements

start on a new line Examples include: `<h1>` `<p>` `<ul>` `<li>`
