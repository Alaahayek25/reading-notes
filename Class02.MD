# Quotations 

`<blockquote>`
The`<blockquote>` element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph. Note
how the `<p>` element is still
used inside the <`blockquote>`
element. 

> Browsers tend to indent the
contents of the `<blockquote>`
element, however you should not
use this element just to indent a
piece of text — rather you should
achieve this effect using CSS. 
>
>> `<q>`
The `<q>` element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph. Browsers are
supposed to put quotes around
the `<q> `element, however
Internet Explorer does not —
therefore many people avoid
using the `<q>` element.
Both elements may use the cite
attribute to indicate where the
quote is from. Its value should
be a URL that will have more
information about the source of
the quotation.

> ### HTML elements are used to describe the structure ofthe page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
>
> - They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
> - acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)

 # CSS 

  - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
 - Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
-  Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
 - Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
 - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

# JS

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

 ## Decisions and Loops
Often scripts need to behave differently depending on how the user interacts with the webpage and / or browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often rely on the following three concepts:

1.LOOPS :
 There are also many occasions when you want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.

2. DECISIONS:
Using the results of
evaluations, you can
decide which path your
script should go down.
3. EVALUATIONS :
You can analyze values in
your scripts to determine
whether or note they
match expected results.
